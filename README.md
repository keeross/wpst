# wpst

wpst - is a wordpress starter template for theme developers.
Clean, vanilla [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) functions without framework abstractions and unbeliaveble file mess in folders. 
Work in progress.

It is not a framework, nor library, it is a set of recommendations for good folder and file structure in wordpress themes.
I have seen lots of templates created by different people, with good file structure and bad.
To be honest, more often I saw really awful and messy themes.
